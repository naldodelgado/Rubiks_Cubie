# RUBIK'S CUBE

Created this just to know how long it would take me to do the same 
4 repetitive moves to get a fully solved rubik's cube back to its original solved state

## What was I trying to accomplish?

The moves consist in fixing one of the cube's faces and then rotate the right slice, then the upper slice and then the left 
slice and finally the lower slice to close one iteration of the loop. It would be somewhat of a circular momentum, get a rubik's on your hand and see what i mean
Them moves are here represented:

- Right slice clock wise
- Upper slice clock wise
- Left slice clock wise
- Lower slice clock wise
- (and guess what) The right slice again to restart the loop.

Want to do this over and over again until It got fixed.

## Next challenge

I'll be later using this to train an AI model that will solve it. I'll do it for fun later.
Since I get to bored to learn the actual algorithm to solve it myself. I'll just train something to do it for me.

### This way no one can say I can't solve a rubik's cube
